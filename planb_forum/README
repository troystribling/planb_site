== Beast -  Two's company. Three's a forum. More's a Beast.

A small, light-weight forum in Rails with a scary name and a goal of around 500 lines of code when we're done. [1]

[1] The 500 LOC limit has officially been put to rest (http://beast.caboo.se/forums/1/topics/681), however the goal is unchanged: clean, readable code, and a great minimal forum app.  Less is more.
