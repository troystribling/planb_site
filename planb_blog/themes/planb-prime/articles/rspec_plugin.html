<p>
Testing a Rails plugin requires that it be implemented in a test application. <a href="http://www.pluginaweek.org/2006/11/24/plugin-tip-of-the-week-testing-your-plugins-the-right-way/" target="blank">PluginAWeek</a> describes how to accomplish this 
by embedding a test application in the plugin. Building on this, here <a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/index.html" target="blank">RSpec</a> is installed in the test application so that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development" target="blank">Behavior Driven Development</a> may be used for plugin development.
</p>
<p>
  All of the code examples presented here are from the  
  <a href="http://research.inplanb.com/has_ancestor">has_ancestor</a>   
  Ruby on Rails plugin. 
</p>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>
  Begin by building a Rails test application as described in <a href="http://www.pluginaweek.org/2006/11/24/plugin-tip-of-the-week-testing-your-plugins-the-right-way/" target="blank">PluginAWeek</a>. 
  Install both the <a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/documentation/rails/install.html" target="blank">RSpec and Rspec Rails</a> plugins in the test 
application.

  Next, bootstrap Rspec.

<h3>Configure</h3>
<p>
  There are two ways to configure RSpec. In one of the 
  configurations specs are run from <code>$RAILS_ROOT</code> 
  of the test application in the other specs are run from
  the top level directory of the plugin. The first 
  configuration would not differ from using RSpec in a normal Rails
  application. The second configuration will be described in the 
  remainder of this section.
