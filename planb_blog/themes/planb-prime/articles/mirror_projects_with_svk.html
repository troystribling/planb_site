  <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/view/HomePage" target="blank">SVK</a> is a version control system written in Perl that 
  utilizes <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="blank">SVN</a>. 
  Among the many features SVK adds to SVN is the ability to synchronize SVN repositories while maintaining commit changelog information. 
  This article will describe how to configure SVK to mirror a local development SVN repository to a public read-only 
  SVN repository such as <a href="http://rubyforge.org/" target="blank">RubyForge</a>. While SVN provides the ability to synchronize 
  repositories with <code>svnsync</code> in versions 1.4 and higher, 
  <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/2007/03/31/setting-up-svnsync-ed-mirrored-svn-repositories-on-ubuntu-part-2-of-2/"  target="blank">the destination repository requires a 
  modification to the <code>pre-revprop-change</code> hook</a> which is usually not possible with a public repository. 
  SVK does not need this modification, which makes it better suited for the application that is the subject of this article.  
  <a href="http://www.bieberlabs.com/wordpress/svk-tutorials/" target="blank">Other features</a> of SVK make it worth a look but
  are not discussed here.

<h3>Install SVK</h3>
<p>
<code>yum</code> can be used to install SVK on Fedora.
</p>
<p>
<typo:code>

   yum install perl-SVK
      
</typo:code>
</p>
<h3>Configure an SVK Depot</h3>
<p>
  The SVK depot can be thought of as the dock for all of the repositories managed by
  the local SVK installation. Begin by creating a depot with a 
  default configuration.
</p>
<p>
<typo:code>

   svk depotmap --init
      
</typo:code>
</p>
<p>
  If the user that issued the command is <code>svk</code> the  
  default configuration will create the depot in the  
  <code>/home/svk/.svk</code> 
  directory. List all depots to see the new depot.
</p>
<p>
<typo:code>

   svk depotmap --list
    
</typo:code>
</p>
<p>
<typo:code>

  Depot                   Path
  ============================================================
  //                      /home/svk/.svk/local
    
</typo:code>
</p>
<p>
  In this listing <code>//</code> is the default depot name and the indicated path is the default depot path. It is possible
  to manage multiple depots by giving them names, see the <a href="http://svkbook.elixus.org/" target="blank">SVK Online Book</a>
  for more information.
</p>
<h3>Create SVK Mirrors of SVN Repositories</h3>
<p>
  After creating the depot the SVN repositories to be managed must be mirrored in the depot. Here the term mirror refers to the 
  linkage between the SVK depot and the SVN repository. First the SVK mirror of the local
  project repository will be created and then a RubyForge SVK mirror. When creating the SVK mirrors
  the full name of the mirror, including the mirror depot, and the URL to the SVN repository must be specified.
</p>
<p>
<typo:code>

  svk mirror //project_local http://localhost/svn/project
  svk mirror //project_rubyforge svn+ssh://user@rubyforge.org/var/svn/project
    
</typo:code>
</p>
<p>
  List all mirrors to see the new mirrors.
<p>
<p>
<typo:code>

  svk mirror --list
    
</typo:code>
</p>
<p>
<typo:code>

  Path                       Source
  =============================================================================
  //project_local       http://localhost/svn/project
  //project_rubyforge   svn+ssh://user@rubyforge.org/var/svn/project
    
</typo:code>
</p>
<p>
 In this listing the items under Path, <code>//project_local</code> and <code>//project_rubyforge</code>, 
 are the SVK paths to the mirrors,
 <code>//</code> indicates the containing depot, and the items under Source are the respective URLs of the mirrored SVN repositories. The
 SVK mirror paths will be used to reference the mirrors in all SVK commands.
</p>
<p>
  The SVK mirrors must now be initialized by synchronizing with their SVN repositories. Since the RubyForge repository is assumed
  to be read-only this is the only time synchronization needs to be performed.
</p>
<p>
<typo:code>

  svk sync //project_local
  svk sync //project_rubyforge
    
</typo:code>
</p>
<h3>Mirror Local SVN Repository to Public SVN Repository</h3>
<p>
  SVK is now configured to mirror the local repository <code>//project_local</code> to remote public repository <code>//project_rubyforge</code>. 
  Here when the term mirror is used it is referring to the process of duplicating the local repository in the public repository.
  The first synchronization of the remote repository with the local respoistory must be done manually. 
  Subsequent synchronizations may be automated. This is required to cache authentication credentials for
  <code>http</code> and <code>svn</code>. Caching of credentials is not supported for <code>ssh+svn</code>, which is used by RubyForge, 
  so public key authentication must be used. 
</p>
<p>
  Synchronization of the repositories only requires two commands. The first synchronizes 
  <code>//project_local</code> and the second merges <code>//project_local</code> with <code>//project_rubyforge</code>.
  It should be noted that the SVK command used is <code>smerge</code> not <code>merge</code>. 
</p>
<p>
<typo:code>

  svk sync //project_local
  svk smerge --baseless --incremental --verbatim //project_local //project_rubyforge
    
</typo:code>
</p>
<h3>Automation</h3>
<p>
   The simplest automation method is to write a script containing the two SVK commands that perform synchronization and execute it periodically
   with a <code>cron</code> job. 
</p>
<p>
  If a more timely update is required it is possible to modify the local SVN repository <code>post-commit</code> hook to execute
  the SVK synchronization commands. 
  <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/read_only_svn_mirror_with_svk"  target="blank">Creating a Read-Only Mirror of Your SVN Repository 
  with SVK</a> describes how to do this for Debian Linux where SVN is accessed over <code>http</code>. It seems straight forward to extend the solution
  to Redhat Linux for <code>http</code> access and to both for access though <code>svn</code>.
