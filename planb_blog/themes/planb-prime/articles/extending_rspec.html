<p>
<a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/index.html">RSpec</a> is a Ruby 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">Behavior Driven Development</a> DSL. 
In this article methods of extending the functionality of RSpec will be described. 
This includes adding both custom <a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/documentation/expectations.html">matchers</a> and methods within 
the scope of RSpec <code>describe</code> blocks. Both 
<a href="http://www.ibrasten.com/articles/2007/6/1/effectively-communicating-your-expectations">Brasten Sager</a> and 
<a href="http://opensoul.org/2007/4/18/rspec-model-should-be_valid">Brandon Keepers</a> describe how to add 
custom matchers by extending <code>Spec::Rails::Matchers</code>. Neither described their configuration, RSpec gem or plugin, 
nor exactly what was done to place the matchers within the scope of the <code>describe</code> block.
Also, this extension method will only be applicable when the the RSpec Rails plugin is used. The method of adding custom 
matchers described here will not have a dependency on <code>Spec::Rails::Matchers</code>. The basis of the method 
used in this article is derived from that of 
<a href="http://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/2007/01/02/customizing-rspec">Nick Sieger</a> for an older version of RSpec. 
For newer versions of RSpec the names of the modules and classes have changed but the strategy is the same.
