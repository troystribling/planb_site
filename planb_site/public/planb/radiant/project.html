      <a href="/has_ancestor">has_ancestor</a> is a Ruby on Rails plug-in that adds two class methods to ActiveRecord::Base 
      that allow specification of inheritance relations between ActiveRecord models. With           
      the method has_ancestor an ancestor relation is declared between a descendant model and its ancestor and with the 
      method has_descendants a descendant relation is declared between an          
      ancestor model and its descendants. Once ancestor and descendant relations are declared between models the models interact 
      as would be expected from class inheritance, ancestor 
      instance and class methods may be called from the descendant model, this permits access to ancestor attributes from the 
      descendant model, and methods may be implemented to behave polymorphically.

      <a href="/acts_as_aln">acts_as_aln</a>, or Acts as Abstract Layered Network, is a Ruby on Rails plug-in that provides an infrastructure for construction of enterprise 
      information models. The Abstract Layered
      Network model is inspired by the network information models described in 
      <a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3100/en">ITU M.3100</a>, <a href="http://www.tmforum.org/browse.aspx?catID=1718&linkID=32960">TMF 814</a> and 
      <a href="http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/ido/AUX/GR_1093_TOC.i02.pdf">Telecordia GR-1093-CORE</a> that attempt to develop detailed object models that describe many of the 
      attributes and state transitions of communication networks. In this vein <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/">the DMTF Common Information Model</a> 
      attempts to develop a model of the enterprise infrastructure. Instead following the path pursued by these efforts acts_as_aln only considers a few objects, 
      the relations between the objects and a couple of attribute types, namely, the information that most strongly impacts the structure of an application built on model. 
      This greatly simplifies the information model and extends its domain of applicability. While the other models are limited to communications networks, and enterprise 
      hardware and software in the case of DMTF-CIM, acts_as_aln can be applied to these domains and possibly to seemingly unrelated domains such as project management, customer 
      relationship management, human resource management, business intelligence and financial management.

      <a href="/linux-agent">linux agent</a> is an implementation of acts_as_aln applied to Red Hat and Debian Linux dialects. Linux Agent provides the ability to discover 
      system resources and configuration
      and report system performance using <a href="http://perso.orange.fr/sebastien.godard/tutorial.html">SYSSTAT</a>.
