      <a href="http://research.inplanb.com/has_ancestor">has_ancestor</a> is a Ruby on Rails plug-in that provides an implementation of 
      <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/classTableInheritance.html" target="_blank">Class Table Inheritance</a> based on 
      <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UnderstandingPolymorphicAssociations" target="_blank">Rails Polymorphic Associations</a>. The plugin
      adds two methods to <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>, <code>has_ancestor</code> and <code>has_descendants</code>. 
      With <code>has_descendants</code> a model
      declares that its attributes and methods are inheritable. With
      <code>has_ancestor</code> a model declares that it inherits the attributes and methods of the specified model. Once ancestor
      and descendant relations are declared the models interact as expected from class inheritance, this includes defining methods that 
      behave in a polymorphic manner. See <a href="http://plans.inplanb.com/articles/2007/06/28/construct-model-abstractions-with-has_ancestor" target="_blank">

      acts_as_aln, or Acts as Abstract Layered Network, is a Ruby on Rails plug-in that provides an infrastructure for construction of enterprise 
      information models. The Abstract Layered
      Network model is inspired by the network information models described in 
      <a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3100/en" target="_blank">ITU M.3100</a>, <a href="http://www.tmforum.org/browse.aspx?catID=1718&linkID=32960" target="_blank">TMF 814</a> and 
      <a href="http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/ido/AUX/GR_1093_TOC.i02.pdf" target="_blank">Telecordia GR-1093-CORE</a> that attempt to develop detailed object models that describe many of the 
      attributes and state transitions of communication networks. In this vein <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/" target="_blank">the DMTF Common Information Model</a> 
      attempts to develop a model of the enterprise infrastructure. Of the previously stated references only DMTF has documentation
      in the public domain. Instead of following the path pursued by these efforts acts_as_aln only considers a few objects, 
      the relations between the objects and a couple of attribute types, namely, the information that most strongly impacts the structure of an application built on the model. 
      This greatly simplifies the information model and extends its domain of applicability. While the other models are limited to communications networks, and enterprise 
      hardware and software in the case of DMTF-CIM, because of their detail, acts_as_aln can be applied to these domains and possibly to seemingly unrelated domains such as project management, customer 
      relationship management, human resource management and business intelligence.
