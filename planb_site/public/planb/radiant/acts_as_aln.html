      acts_as_aln, or Acts as Abstract Layered Network, is a Ruby on Rails plug-in that provides an infrastructure for construction of enterprise 
      information models. The Abstract Layered
      Network model is inspired by the network information models described in 
      <a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3100/en">ITU M.3100</a>, <a href="http://www.tmforum.org/browse.aspx?catID=1718&linkID=32960">TMF 814</a> and 
      <a href="http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/ido/AUX/GR_1093_TOC.i02.pdf">Telecordia GR-1093-CORE</a> that attempt to develop detailed object models that describe many of the 
      attributes and state transitions of communication networks. In this vein <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/">the DMTF Common Information Model</a> 
      attempts to develop a model of the enterprise infrastructure. Of the previously stated references only DMTF has documentation
      in the public domain. Instead following the path pursued by these efforts acts_as_aln only considers a few objects, 
      the relations between the objects and a couple of attribute types, namely, the information that most strongly impacts the structure of an application built on model. 
      This greatly simplifies the information model and extends its domain of applicability. While the other models are limited to communications networks, and enterprise 
      hardware and software in the case of DMTF-CIM because of their detail, acts_as_aln can be applied to these domains and possibly to seemingly unrelated domains such as project management, customer 
      relationship management, human resource management, business intelligence and financial management.
