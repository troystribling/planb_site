=== 0.6.0 Lapidary (April 24, 2007)

* Merged Behaviors into the Page class; subclass page now instead

* r:children:each, r:children:first, and r:children:last now all accept the
  same ordering and limit attributes and have the same defaults
* Snippets are now responsive to global context via the r:page tag. This means 
  that any tags inside r:page will refer to the page currently being rendered, 
  i.e. the page requested, not the local contextual page via tags like 
  r:children:each, etc. This is most relevant to recursive snippets like the 
  sitemapper example [Sean Cribbs]
* r:navigation now uses the pipe character ("|") to delimit URLs in the urls 
  attribute rather than the semi-colon
* :date now accepts a "for" attribute that specifies which attribute of the 
  page to render. Valid values of the attribute are published_at, updated_at, 
  created_at, and now.

  interface

* Caching no longer stores the headers and body in the same file [Daniel 
  Sheppard]
* Added support for the X-Sendfile header that works in conjunction with 
  caching to speed it up (by default X-Sendfile support is off) [Daniel 
  Sheppard]
* Moved the images and stylesheets into images/admin and stylesheets/admin
  respectively to make it easier for Radiant's assets to coexist easily with
  the site's assets
* Improved the Javascript that automatically updates the slug and breadcrumb
  based off of the title so that it now response to all change events
* For the full scoop on what's changed see Sean Cribbs' detailed blog post:
